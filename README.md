Revisiting GKR (https://github.com/kkalouli/GKR_semantic_parser) but for mathematical texts, not using Java to make it more accessible.

First, we want to create representations,  in CNLL-U format (https://universaldependencies.org/format.html)
for the sentences/pairs in  https://github.com/vcvpaiva/MathNLI2024-/blob/main/gold-final-0116.txt.

The suggestion is to use either spaCy or UDPipe whichever you think it's easier.
